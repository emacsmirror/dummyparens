* About
Dummyparens is a simple utility providing parentheses auto-pairing and
wrapping behavior

It's intended to be minimalistic and non-invasive as you would expect
such simple functionality to be.

For more sophisticated features, like HTML tags or LaTeX environments
handling, consider looking at [[https://github.com/Fuco1/smartparens][smartparens]].

* Configuration
** Initialization
Put this in your ~/.emacs file
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (when (require 'dummyparens nil t)
    (dp-bind-trigger-keys))
#+END_SRC

** Customization
You can customize dp-pairs variable to add or remove symbols that have
to be paired. E.g.
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (setq dp-pairs '(
                   ("(" ")" nil)
                   ("[" "]" nil)
                   ("{" "}" dp-brace-post-handler)
                   ("\"" "\"" nil)
                   ))
#+END_SRC
